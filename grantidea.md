For my grant proposal, my project would focus on the giant corpus of writing left by Frances Parkinson Keyes. Over the course of her fifty year career she wrote over fifty novels and hundreds of magazine articles. As one of the best-selling women authors in her time, Francesâ€™s work spoke to women across the nation and across the globe. This project is multi-faceted, and can encompass topic modeling and analysis of her books and magazine articles, which can track the changes she made in her style of writing as well as the content. In addition to analysis of text, her work can also be geographically mapped to include where Frances was traveling, where her novels took place, and where she wrote articles about. There can also be information on which books sold, which of her novels were translated into foreign languages and how well they were received. A more in depth analysis of her work would lead to a greater understanding of Keyes herself, as well as her audience beginning with Good Housekeeping in the early 1920s all the way till her death in 1970.  


Initial Feedback: Excellent project! Some things to think about:

- What new scholarly questions can we ask or try to answer by topic modeling her work? 
- Topic modeling: How do you plan to topic model? Her entire corpus? Pars of her corpus? For example, build a topic model of her letters and a topic model of her writings? Take a look at topic modeling projects like Signs at 40 to get ideas for interfaces if you want to this route!
- Mapping:  Wil this be just one map or multiple maps? Could the idea of "deep maps" be helpful?
- Exhibition: This project seems to assume it will be a digital website project. If so, make that explicit. It also seems like connecting this to your work at the museum and proposing this as a grant for the museum might be a fun way to approach this! 

The project is multifaceted in an exciting way but make sure to be specific about what parts of her work you are applyng which techniques and for which purposes!  Happy to meet to discuss!
