# Abstract:


The main objective of our project is to track how the dialectical tendencies of rappers change/develop over time, and what that tells us about the changes of society as a whole. Our project looks at lyrics of the twenty most popular rappers during a five year period between 1980 and present day. Those lyrics, ones from the rapper’s most popular songs during that five year period, are documented and filed into a dataset. We then run the dataset through a topic modeling process in order to better understand the message of the lyrics as a whole. From the results, we expect to conclude which phrases or words are unique to particular rappers and which phrases or words are used in a more wide scale way across the entire rap community. Once this information is gathered, we will have a much easier time pinpointing what specific rap lines appeal to rap fans and consumers. We will also research where each specific rapper  was raised and what conditions they were raised in (for instance relationship with family, criminal history, history of drug abuse) and look at how that has an impact on the theme of their lyrics. Our results could prove to be very useful and even profitable when you consider the interest a rapper’s agent would have in understanding how the makeup of the lyrics needs to look in order for an artist to be successful. Overall, we hope the research on these lyrics will reflect the change in society’s lyrical tastes and preferences and the character of that society in general.




# Narrative:




## 1. Enhancing the Humanities:
We are going to use the topic modeling process on gephi to analyze the lyrics of rappers from seven different eras, each of which spans five years. We came to the conclusion that we felt five years was enough time for the rap culture to change a significant amount, but decided that something along the lines of 10 years would allow for too drastic of a change. 
Our first group of rappers is from the era 1980-1985. We chose to include Sugar Hill Gang, Grandmaster Flash, Kurtis Blow, Run DMC, and Doug E Fresh because we found them to be some of the most popular and influential artists from that time span. For our next five year time period, we chose Public Enemy, Rakim, LL Cool J, Biz Markie, and KRS-One to represent the years from 1985-1990. Then we chose to look at lyrics from A Tribe Called Quest, Ice Cube, The Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur and De La Soul. Its interesting to note that the next group of rappers we chose is the first group that we were alive while their music was coming out. After the turn of the twenty first century, we found we had a much better idea of who the most influential rappers would be. We chose Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Jay-Z, Nas, and Dr. Dre. Looking at the years with 2000-2005, our top five rappers are Andre 3000 (Outkast), 50 Cent, Kanye West, The Game, and T.I.. The following five years focus on Lil Wayne, Drake, Rick Ross, Young Jeezy, and Wiz Khalifa. Predictably, the final group was the easiest for us to assemble. We all consider ourselves rap fans to an extent, so determining who is at the forefront of the industry right now came naturally to us. We chose Kendrick Lamar, J Cole, Freddie Gibbs, Young Thug, and Future in our seventh and final group. For each rapper, we took their ten most popular songs and collected the lyrics from those songs into a dataset with all the other lyrics of rappers from that five year time period. Their top 10 most popular songs from their respective eras were then topic modeled using 30 topics.
A necessary step in this process is to make sure to take out stop words that we deem aren’t important enough to be part of the topic model. This is an important process because we do not want to include words such as “the, and, but, or, because, yes, no, it,” as they do not have any significance on what we are attempting to discover from this project. Once we figure out which sayings or phrases appear in the lyrics of multiple influential rappers from different eras, we will have a good idea of what rap fans want to hear during certain time periods, and maybe even discover rap trends that transcend time. We feel this knowledge could be very useful for the rap world in the sense that it would be inspirational for rappers looking to find their sound in a way that will appeal to as many people as possible. Our experiment is particularly relevant at this point in time because the rap industry is larger now than it has ever been. It would also reveal what captures our society's’ attention and how that varies over time. Fans of rap might benefit from this research project because if we can specify which parts of the rap they like, rappers will be able to adjust and ultimately make the music more enjoyable for the listener. 
 Some major questions we would be looking to address with this research include:
	How do people’s tastes in rap lyrics differ from one era to the next?
What words and phrases are shared by famous rappers from the same eras and who      are they? From different eras?
Which words or phrases that were repeated many times by the same rapper were unique to only that rapper? What may have contributed to these lines becoming outliers?	
What social conditions may have contributed to the style in which rappers form their lyrics?
What is the correlation between where a rapper grew up and what type of lyrics he uses in his music?
We hope in answering these questions we will be able to have a better understanding on how society reflects rap music and what impacts rap music lyrics have on society’s attitudes towards certain subjects. There is a chance that after our results are generated, some questions may remain unanswered, but keeping these questions in mind throughout the process is a good way to direct our thinking and make sure we don't shy away from our main objectives. 
	


## 2. Environmental Scan: 


One project in the similar field we would like to acknowledge is entitled “The Largest Vocabulary in Hip Hop” by Matt Daniels on polygraph.com (http://poly-graph.co/vocabulary.html). This project ranks rappers by the number of unique words used in their lyrics and graphs those results.to show the different rappers compared to each other and some famous authors such as Shakespeare and Moby Dick. He adds more layers by also providing an option to show the regions of where the rappers are from (Southern, Midwest, East coast, and West coast) and to show only members of the Wu-Tang Clan. Both of these options are quite insightful, as the region that the artist is from has an impact on their vocabulary used. For instance, most of the southern and West coast rappers are on the lower end of the spectrum. The Wu-tang clan option is also interesting, because all of the members shown are all at the upper end of the spectrum. This just goes to show how influential that group was to the genre of rap music in general. He further analyzes each artist in depth, showing that obscure rapper Aesop Rock dominates the list, and the percentage of lyrics contributed to a song by each Wu-Tang member. We found this project very fascinating, and it provided useful information when considering which rappers to include and also the impact a certain region may have on lyrical ability. 
Another project we looked into was written by Gretchen Cundiff from the Elon Journal of Undergraduate Studies in Communications entitled “The Influence of Rap and Hip-Hop Music: An Analysis on Audience Perceptions of Misogynistic Lyrics” (http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/792/3/the-influence-of-rap-and-hip-hop-music-an-analysis-on-audience-perceptions-of-misogynistic-lyrics). In this article, Cundiff explains how she uses a content analysis method to analyze 20 rap/hip-hop songs from 2000-2010. These 20 songs were chosen based on the misogynistic themes that appeared within each rapper's lyrics. All of the popular hits were labeled as explicit. The coding outcome showed that most of the songs were coded for physical violence, or some sort of misogynistic content. Other coding detected that some lyrics consisted of sexual assault, demeaning language, and sexual conquest. These results were also portrayed through various graphs of different themes, for instance levels of misogyny, whether low, medium, or high. The highest percentage (50%) of lyrics were marked to have a low amount of misogyny, next medium (40%), and lowest high amounts of misogyny (10%). She also took surveys from the public as to what their attitudes were towards rap music, finding that more men listen than women, and less women think highly of rap music than men. We felt these findings, specifically the ones showing the percentages of lyrics pertaining to misogyny and sexual violence and the attitudes towards these lyrics, highly corresponded with what our project is attempting to find. 




## 3. History of the Project:


For the rappers, we initially referred to Billboard music charts to see which artists were
the most popular during the specific time periods.We chose Billboard because they have always been a popular source for the most listened to music. Once we considered the top artists in the charts and our own knowledge of popular artists during that time, we compiled a list of musicians. Then we researched their most popular songs and found the lyrics to those songs with rapgenius.com. We consulted rapgenius because it is one of the biggest resources for lyrics, specifically for rap songs. Our other research was put in after the topic model was complete, where we derived certain themes from the lyrics and researched if those themes corresponded with the opinion of popular society as well and what social conditions led to these themes to be portrayed. 




## 4. Work Plan:


1. Outline what criteria we will consider (for instance time frame of rappers, which rappers, which songs).
2. Access Billboard.com to research the most popular rappers and document the five most popular/influential rappers of each five year period between 1980 and present day. 
3. Research the ten most popular songs of each rap artist we documented and compile all of the lyrics for each five year period into separate datasets. 
4. Run each dataset through a topic model using 30 topics respectively.
5. Remove stop words as we see them, and run each edited version through another topic model at least two more times. This is to ensure we are only receiving lyrics that contribute to what we are attempting to discover. 
6. Investigate each topic model to find what the main themes of the lyrics were for those rappers during that time period. 
7. Compare the difference between each period and document how the topics of the lyrics change if they do at all. 
8. Once the themes have been found, use them to research corresponding trends in society (for instance if there is an abundance of sexual violence in lyrics, was sexual violence highly prevalent in the communities of those rappers or in society as a whole during that time period?).
9. Consider if rap lyrics are a form of social change and investigate if the answer to that is evident in our findings.

## 6. Final Product and Dissemination: 


Once our project is complete, we would first attempt to put our findings on an accessible website. We found that the other projects we mentioned in the environmental scan section were both presented well on a website that was easily findable and presented their projects in very clear and easy to understand ways. This is important as we want to ensure that people will one want to read our project and two, when they do read it, that they will be able to understand it. Once our website is built, we will first advertise it using various social media outlets (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). We chose to do this first because it is one of the easiest and most efficient ways to get the word out about our project. We have lots of connections on social media with friends who also listen to rap music so we feel this would gather a decent following for our project initially. After this, we would attempt to reach out to major music media outlets, such as Pitchfork, Noisey, HotNewHipHop, and XXL Magazine. If one of these media outlets were to advertise our project this would obviously provide a lot of attention towards it and help share our results with the public. We feel our findings could be very useful to this field as they show the changes in the attitudes both poured into music and the attitudes towards music throughout the past 35 years. These findings could show very insightful things about society and our views toward certain subject matters, and whether or not we should attempt to change things.
