#Abstract
Universities across the United States are conducting projects that seek to uncover and interrogate the history of structural oppression at their respective institutions. At the University of Richmond, these aims have taken the form of the Race and Racism Project, which seeks to analyze how race related to, and continues to relate to, power and the greater university narrative. Examining how the collective memory of the university pairs with certain primary documents unarchived, the project seeks to spotlight formative moments of race relations and individuals that may be forgotten when discussing the story of the university. There are two recent addition to the project: an exhibit that focused solely on recognition and representation for students of color throughout the university’s history; and, a timeline leading up to integration at the university. This project seeks to use the groundwork laid by those facets to begin to explore how the university responded as the push for diversity became more apparent. By using the accounts of students of color, which is inclusive on national and international students, this projects seeks to create a visual component to track students of color based on where they enrolled from and how their attendance evolved over time. The final product intends on both mapping the locations of where various students of color came to the university from and where the university held outreach events, as well as visualizing these place-to-place relations through an ego-network situated over the map layers.
