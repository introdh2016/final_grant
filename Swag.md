For our project, we tried to find areas that matched our interests, specifically music and sports. For this reason, our first idea we would like to pursue is the connection between certain sports agents and successful athletes over time. Some of the questions we would want to be answered would be why certain athletes sign with certain agents, what are the factors that make the more popular agents successful, are there certain patterns that athletes or agents follow in their process of contracting with each other.

Another idea we have, also relating to sports, is researching th ehometowns of professional athletes, mainly football and basketball players. The reason we wanted to research this is because we think it could show some very interesting things as to which areas of the United States/abroad produces the most athletes than other and what are the factors that create those situations.

Our third and final idea we have for our project has to do with our other main interest, music, specifically rap/hip-hop. We are more interested in researching the lyrics of popular rappers and how they have changed from the 1980s to present day. We thought this would be really interesting because it could show how the themes of lyrics change, what impacts the themes and the things rappers talk about, and the change in the actual words and vocabulary rappers use over time as well. These are the three most interesting topics we would like to pursue and feel they could bring about some really interesting discoveries and insights.

Initial Feedback:  All of these are great ideas!  I like how the team is beginning to post which questions the project will help answer. This is a critical component and helps the reader understand what humanities questions are at stake. The first one looks  like a network project (which we will be covering this week), the second is a mapping project/ spatial analysis project, and the third is a text analysis project. If one were to try to actually do the project, the first strikes me as the most difficult.  The second and third might actually be something the team could pursue down the line.

Another thought is that you don't have to have the data already so in the grant you will want to talk about how you will collect it. For example, will you use the athlets profiles on ESPN.com?  I'm not sure how you collect data for agents, although I'm curious! For the third, check out [rap genius](http://rap.genius.com/).   

Interestingly, I can't think of a DH sports project. If you go with sports, the environmental scan will  want to highlight that and then you'll want to reference projects that use similar methods.  These are some initial thoughts. I'm happy to m eet and discuss further or let me know which topic the team decides on and we can go from there.
